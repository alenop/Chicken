# Chicken

This project have for objective to provide a API with chickens.
for working to create a database before and change the password in the file PostgresClient.js before using the app. It will be changed later for a environmental variable. (Don't do that change later on your project once a password is on internet it's dangerous, i don't use this password except here so it's somewhat OK)
To launch the app do the command node initdb.js then node app.js.
The API basic is acceded with /chicken on port 8000.
For now you can create chickens and let them running. Right now it just add 1 step, later add 1 step by a passing time with a speed steps/hour.
Now you can even let them rest !!

/chicken/run for running
/chicken/rest for let them rest

You can test with the Postman app.
